## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS


### What I learned

You can use grid to fix the design when it breaks
in different needs. I did not use media queries for
that. But, websites built for the users of older
browser versions must use flex or other browser
compatible technologies as grid does not support
older versions of browsers.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I want to continue learning grid.
